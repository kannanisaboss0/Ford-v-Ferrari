Introduction:
It was a cold night... The only audible things were the sound of the revving engines and the tires screeching, fighting for grip. If smell existed, it would be of gasoline and burnt rubber that night. 
This was the scene of the 1951 LeMans 24 hrs. 24hrs, yes you heard it right, you have sit on scorching leather on the day and get frozen at night. Among the many racers who had risk their commitment and life to win , there was one man, a genius, a racer to his heart- Carrol Shelby,. Sadly after winning  LeMans, he 
suffered from a heart condition; he was lucky to even be alive after the race. He was hindered. He once famously said"6000 RPM, the point of no return, if the machine reaches it, you will only be a body flying through time and space, in the air
My only question is"who are you""
