Introduction:
It was a cold night... The only audible things were the sound of the revving engines and the tires screeching, fighting for grip. If smell existed, it would be of gasoline and burnt rubber that night. 
This was the scene of the 1951 LeMans 24 hrs. 24hrs, yes you heard it right, you have sit on scorching leather on the day and get frozen at night.
